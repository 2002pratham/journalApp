# ðŸ““ Journal App  

I developed a **Journal Application** leveraging modern **microservices architecture** to provide secure, scalable, and real-time journal management.  
This project integrates **Spring Boot, JWT, Kafka, Redis, and MongoDB** to ensure high performance, security, and an enriched user experience.  

## ðŸ”¥ Tech Stack & Architecture  

- **Spring Boot & JWT**: Built a secure authentication and authorization system with role-based access control.  
- **Microservices Architecture**: Designed a distributed system using Kafka for event-driven communication and MongoDB for efficient data storage.  
- **Redis Caching**: Optimized response time and database load by implementing Redis for frequently accessed data.  
- **Kafka Event Streaming**: Enabled real-time sentiment analysis and automated notifications based on user journal entries.  
- **Weather API Integration**: Provided users with contextual journaling experiences by incorporating real-time weather data with caching mechanisms.  

## ðŸ›  Core Features  

- **Secure Authentication & Role-Based Access**: Implemented JWT-based authentication to ensure data privacy and user access control.  
- **Automated Sentiment Tracking**: Analyzed journal entries using AI to provide sentiment-based insights and trends.  
- **Real-Time Event Processing**: Leveraged Kafka to asynchronously process and analyze user entries, ensuring a seamless experience.  
- **Email Notifications & Alerts**: Sent automated email reports and updates based on user activity and sentiment patterns.  
- **Optimized Performance with Caching**: Integrated Redis caching to store frequently accessed data and reduce API call latency.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways from the Project  

- **Building Scalable Microservices** with event-driven architecture using Kafka.  
- **Optimizing Performance** using Redis caching for frequent API calls.  
- **Enhancing Security & Access Control** with JWT-based authentication.  
- **Automating Sentiment Analysis** to provide real-time insights to users.  
- **Integrating External APIs** for dynamic user experiences (e.g., Weather API).  

ðŸš€ This project highlights the power of **distributed systems, event-driven architecture, and AI-driven insights** in real-world applications. Looking forward to expanding its functionalities and optimizing further! ðŸš€
